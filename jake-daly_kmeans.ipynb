    "Although a relatively simple algorithm in the domain of unsupervised learning, k-means clustering provides a powerful heuristic for understanding the spread of data in a set. In this programming assignment, we will apply the k-means clustering algorithm to a well-known data set, the set of MNIST hand-written numbers, which are 28x28 pixel images. The data are converted from their 28x28 pixel 2-D representations into a more abstract 784-vector representation, so that we can more easily work with the data in the algorithm. \n",

    "We will begin by importing some relevant packages, namely <code>numpy</code>, <code>gzip</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>, to help us import the MNIST data set, as well as visualize an example of what one of these numbers looks like.\n",

For example, if a human were given 100 random photos from this set and told that each photo belonged to one of K = 10 clusters, he or she could instantly categorize them into one of the ten clusters, with each cluster representing one of the ten digits.\n",

    "\n",
    "Below we will define our k-means algorithm, which takes as inputs a list of vectors (our images of numbers represented in 1D), along with a number of groups to cluster them in. The algorithm will perform some book keeping such as the recasting of data as <code>numpy</code> arrays, and allocation of internal variables. The group representatives have been intialized as *K* random vectors from the data_list, as these will (in general) provide starting points for the group representatives which will be closer to their final positions than if we had just initialized everything to zero. This is because we are essentially intializing each group representative to a random hand-written number (represented as a vector), and these vectors will be closer to the final value (which is an an average of all the numbers in that group), as opposed to if we intialized all to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initialization, the algorithm will enter a while loop, which will loop through the algorithm a fixed number of times, iteratively computing the closest group representatives for each vector, and then updating the group representatives to be the average (mean) of all the vectors in that group. Specifically, we will loop through each data vector, and check which group representative it is closest to. We will also keep track of the distance of this data vector from the group representative it's closest to, so that we can later on compute how much total error there is between every vector and its representative. After we determine which vectors belong to which groups, we compute the centroid of that cluster by computing the mean of all the vectors in that group, and using this value to update the group representative. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we compute the sum of the errors of each vector from it's *new* group grepresentative, and save this in a vector J_clust, so that we can see our error improving on each iteration. Once the group assignments have stopped changing from one iteration to the next, we will stop the algorithm because even if we could get incremental improvements of the values of the group representatives, the group's members have converged to their final state."
